<p>This Cookie Notice explains how <strong>StrapazziDesignStudio</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you use our mobile application <strong>DentalEDU</strong> (the "App"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>

<h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
<p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your mobile device when you use an application. Cookies are widely used by app developers to make their apps work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>

<p>Cookies set by the app owner (in this case, StrapazziDesignStudio) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the app owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided within the app (e.g., advertising, analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your device both when it uses our App and when it visits certain other apps or websites.</p>

<h2>2. Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
<p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our App to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us and third parties to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our App. Third parties also serve cookies through our App for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.</p>
